# Docker-Global

Docker Global setup makes it much easier to develop websites. This bundles the most important services into a single package using [Docker](https://docker.com).

The individual websites then still need the [cyb10101/php-dev](https://github.com/Cyb10101/php-dev) package and that's all.

This setup is extensible and well customizable for the individual needs of a project.
